# Security_IntrusionDetectionSystem

## Aim:
With the massive usages of the internet, public network security research becomes more crucial to detect the unauthorized intrusions on network traffic. In this project, we used three machine learning algorithms that are Deep Neural Network (DNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) model on two popular network intrusion datasets for the comparison of ML performance.

## How to reach:
Application of DNN, SVM, and NB.

## Result:
Check the paper.

## Note:
The code is missing. :(
